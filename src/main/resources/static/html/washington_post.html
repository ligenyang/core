    <p>Justice Dept. charges Huawei with fraud, ratcheting up U.S.-China tensions</p>
    <p>Acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker announced Jan. 28 charges against Chinese technology giant Huawei of lying, spying and attempts to obstruct justice. (The Washington Post)</p>
    <p>By Ellen Nakashima and Devlin Barrett January 28 at 8:06 PM</p>
    <p>The Justice Department announced criminal charges Monday against Huawei Technologies, the world’s largest communications equipment manufacturer, and one of its top executives — a move likely to intensify trade tensions between the United States and China.</p>
    <p>A 13-count indictment filed in New York City against Huawei, two affiliates and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, details allegations of bank and wire fraud. The company also is charged with violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and conspiring to obstruct justice related to the investigation.</p>
    <p>Canadian officials arrested Meng on a U.S. warrant Dec. 1. She has been detained in Vancouver since then. Meng could face up to 30 years if found guilty on all counts.</p>
    <p>Top U.S. law enforcement officials, including acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, held a news conference in Washington to announce the charges.</p>
    <p>“The criminal activity in this indictment goes back 10 years and goes all the way to the top of the company,” Whitaker said.</p>
    <p>Wray said firms like Huawei “pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security, and the magnitude of these charges make clear just how seriously the FBI takes this threat.”</p>
    <p>Huawei did not immediately comment on the charges.</p>
    <p>The indictment threatened to further strain relations between Washington and Beijing as officials from both countries prepare for talks this week aimed at ending a months-long economic impasse that has contributed to huge swings in the stock market. Though President Trump had suggested he was willing to help secure Meng’s release if China met his demands for a trade deal, Justice and Commerce department officials insisted Meng’s criminal case was a separate matter.</p>
    <p>Prosecutors said that Huawei — and Meng in particular — lied to banking authorities to avoid questions about whether the company evaded U.S. sanctions prohibiting firms from doing business with Iran.</p>
    <p>According to the indictment, Meng in 2013 made a presentation to a bank executive in which she repeatedly lied about the relationship between Huawei and a company in Iran called Skycom, which prosecutors alleged functioned as a subsidiary. U.S. law prohibits banks operating in the United States from processing dollar transactions related to Iran through the United States.</p>
    <p>The Justice Department also charged that when Huawei became aware of the U.S. investigation in 2017, the company’s American affiliate sought to obstruct that work by trying to move witnesses with knowledge of Huawei’s Iran-based business back to China, where FBI agents could not interview them.</p>
    <p>The charges come as the two countries’ leaders seek to end their months-long trade dispute and with China’s lead trade negotiator, Liu He, scheduled to meet with U.S. officials in Washington in coming days.</p>
    <p>Huawei is one of China’s “national champions,” an $8.4 billion firm promoted and protected by the ruling Communist Party. Meng’s arrest sparked outrage in China, which called for her immediate release and condemned the move as a U.S.- led effort to thwart thetelecom giant and constrain China’s global ambitions.</p>
    <p>Shortly after, in a move widely seen as retaliation for Meng’s arrest, Chinese authorities detained two Canadians, including a former diplomat, on security charges.</p>
    <p>The Justice Department has until Wednesday to issue a formal extradition request for Meng. Last week officials affirmed they were proceeding with the request despite Beijing pressuring Canada to release her.</p>
    <p>The charges grew from a long-running investigation by federal authorities into a rival Chinese telecom company, ZTE, which investigators found in 2012 was secretly diverting U.S.-made computer equipment to Iran through a front company. That probe uncovered evidence Huawei also was diverting equipment to Iran through Skycom.</p>
    <p>Skycom was one of the two affiliates charged. The other was Huawei Device USA.</p>
    <p>According to the indictment and a Justice Department news release, at least two other defendants have been charged but not yet apprehended. Their identities remain under seal.</p>
    <p>In 2017 ZTE pleaded guilty to violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea, and paid $892 million in fines imposed by the Justice, Treasury and Commerce departments.</p>
    <p>As part of the settlement, ZTE admitted it shipped U.S. telecommunications equipment to Iran in violation of the law that bars shipment of U.S.-origin goods to Iran. Investigators also obtained documents that indicated ZTE modeled some of its sanctions-evading behavior after another company, code-named F7.</p>
    <p>F7 was understood by government investigators to be a reference to Huawei, said two people familiar with the case.</p>
    <p>Since Meng’s arrest, Canadian officials have stressed that her case is a legal matter, not a political one. But that message has not been consistent, complicating the standoff.</p>
    <p>Shortly after Meng’s arrest, Trump suggested he might be willing to make a deal to secure her release if he could cut a trade agreement with China, raising concerns from observers about possible politicization of the judicial process.</p>
    <p>Asked Monday if Trump’s suggestion remained a possibility, Whitaker said: “The U.S. Department of Justice does its investigations and charging decisions independent from the White House.”</p>
    <p>Last week, Canada’s ambassador to China, John McCallum, shocked many by saying at a news conference that he thought Meng could make some “strong arguments” to avoid extradition, including what he termed Trump’s “political involvement.”</p>
    <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately distanced his government from the comment and McCallum walked it back — only to tell a reporter the following day that it would be “great” for Canada if the United States dropped the case.</p>
    <p>Trudeau fired McCallum over the weekend.</p>
    <p>Authorities also unsealed a separate 10-count indictment in Washington State, charging Huawei Device Co. with conspiring to steal trade secrets, wire fraud and obstruction of justice. That indictment alleges Huawei conspired to steal from T-Mobile USA the technical details of a phone-testing robot.</p>
    <p>The robot, nicknamed “Tappy,” was of such great interest to Huawei that the company secretly took photos and measurements of the robot and, in one instance, stole its arm so that Huawei engineers could try to replicate it, according to prosecutors. Investigators said that after T-Mobile learned of Huawei’s efforts and threatened to sue, Huawei produced a report falsely claiming the thefts were the work of rogue employees. In fact, U.S. officials said, the FBI had obtained emails showing that in July 2013, Huawei offered bonuses to employees based on the value of information they stole from other companies.</p>
    <p>“Huawei clearly knew it was part of an organized effort to steal technology,” said Annette Hayes, First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington. “This is part of Huawei’s MO.”</p>
